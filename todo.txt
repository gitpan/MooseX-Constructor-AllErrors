- I'm comaint as of Oct 26! release a new version.


+# TODO: around BUILDALL as per below.
+# but I don't want to wrap the call in a try block and parse the
+# errors (and would I need to localize $SIG{__DIE__} ?
+# -- instead should use some sort of lazy require


get TODO tests for BUILD working!

add t/Test-EOL, Test-NoTabs, fix formatting.
